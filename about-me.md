title: About Me
---

Senior Software Engineer at _MongoDB_, where I work on developer-facing tools and system. My current work includes Compass, mongosh, the official MongoDB plugins for VSCode and IntelliJ, and the official MCP Server. I focus on developer experience, language design, and organic architectures. My thinking is shaped as much by production constraints as by experimentation, and I care about the long-term ergonomics of code, teams, and the business. I see myself as a systems-thinker who can jump across abstraction levels, from how something is implemented to how it affects an organisation and the business.

Across more than a decade of experience, Iâ€™ve worked at the intersection of system design, tooling, and developer experience. Iâ€™ve led engineering teams, including organizations of 20+ people, and have worked in Staff Engineer roles where architecture, execution, and cross-team alignment were part of the day-to-day. Iâ€™m especially interested in how boundaries between systems, responsibilities, and mental models can be made explicit and safe to evolve.

Iâ€™ve worked in consulting across a wide range of contexts: from generalist product and platform teams at _ThoughtWorks_, to infrastructure-focused technical engagements at _MongoDB_. In the latter, I designed high-availability, cross-region architectures for large-scale systems, balancing latency, performance, cost, compliance, and operational risk. That work often meant combining hands-on implementation with architectural design and advisory roles, supporting teams during migration, integration, and redesign phases.

Over the years, I've worked on systems across domains such as:
- **database infrastructure and tooling**, like in MongoDB.
- **robotics**, using distributed actor-based coordination;
- **financial systems**, including invoicing, banking, and regulatory-sensitive services;
- **fraud detection and NLP pipelines** for large-scale classification and search;
- **developer tooling platforms** and **marketplace infrastructure** (e.g., classifieds).

Outside of production work, Iâ€™ve explored these ideas further through personal tools and language/runtime experiments:

### Project Modeling Systems
- [**pottery**](https://github.com/kmruiz/pottery): a simplified, convention-driven project model written in Java. It offers a YAML-based, predictable alternative to Maven, with an emphasis on clarity and developer experience.
- [**clpom**](https://github.com/kmruiz/clpom): a minimal project model for Common Lisp. Designed as a simpler alternative to ASDF, focused on reducing boilerplate and improving toolability.

### Language and Runtime Design
- [**Sonata**](https://github.com/kmruiz/sonata): an experimental language built around runtime dispatch, contract-driven APIs, and domain-oriented composition. A work in progress aimed at exploring business-aligned language features.
- [**cl-sonkv**](https://github.com/kmruiz/cl-sonkv): a small key-value store written in Common Lisp. Built for simplicity and transparency, it explores basic durability and data layout without external dependencies.

### UI Architecture Experimentation
- [**morphonent**](https://github.com/kmruiz/morphonent): a functional UI library that models transitions and state via pure functions. Designed to prioritize testability, moldability, and composable UI interactions.

### Delivery Forecasting Tooling
- [**jira-montecarlo**](https://github.com/kmruiz/jira-montecarlo): a CLI tool for probabilistic delivery forecasting. It uses Monte Carlo simulations and throughput data to replace point estimation with statistical modeling.

## What I'm Looking For

Iâ€™m not currently looking for a new role, but I care deeply about the kinds of problems I want to work on next.

In the future, Iâ€™m interested in roles like Staff Engineer or Director of Engineering, where I can extend my current focus to include broader system direction, team topology, and long-term technical strategy. Iâ€™m also exploring how AI (particularly probabilistic models) can support system design conversations, architecture under uncertainty, and evolving requirements.

I'm based in Catalonia and prefer to work remotely, async-first, and with high trust. I speak English (professional level), Catalan, and Spanish (both native). I regularly overlap with timezones from UTCâˆ’1 to UTC+4, and Iâ€™ve successfully worked with distributed teams across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Iâ€™m not open to relocation.

## Mentoring & Talks

I occasionally mentor engineers: especially around system design, architecture and growth. Iâ€™ve also delivered internal architecture reviews, run workshops, and spoken at various conferences in Barcelona on topics like domain modeling, developer experience, and adaptive systems.

Iâ€™m open to more public speaking, guest sessions, or collaborative workshops: especially when the topics align with how organisations build software that changes.

Topics I care about include software boundaries, change-resilient architecture, developer tooling, and AI-assisted software design.

## What I Write About

This page is my notebook. I write about the topics I care about, the systems I explore, and the experiments I run:

* architecture under changing environments
* team boundaries
* developer experience
* the trade-offs behind the systems we build

Lately, Iâ€™ve been especially focused on how language-level abstractions shape runtime and organizational boundaries and how we can design for change instead of resistance.
